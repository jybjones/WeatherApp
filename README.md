# WeatherApp
A weather app developed with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML & CSS/Bootstrap to demonstrate the ability to retrieve the 5-day forecast from a user's zip code from the Weather Underground API.

The app also uses Geolocation to locate the user's current location to deliver their local temperature & current weather condition.


```
To run:
  1) npm install
  2) npm run server to serve on http-server
Okay!
```
